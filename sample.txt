Title: The Impact of Donald Trump on the Global Economy

Abstract: This paper examines the economic policies and actions of Donald Trump during his presidency and their effects on the global economy. It explores the implications of his trade wars, tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation on international trade, investment, and economic growth.

Introduction: Donald Trump's presidency marked a significant shift in U.S. economic policy, with far-reaching consequences for the global economy. His administration's focus on protectionism, deregulation, and tax cuts aimed to boost domestic growth but also led to increased uncertainty and volatility in international markets.

Trade Wars and Tariffs: One of the most notable aspects of Trump's economic policy was his aggressive stance on trade. The imposition of tariffs on imports from China, the European Union, and other trading partners led to retaliatory measures and escalated trade tensions. These trade wars disrupted global supply chains, increased production costs, and reduced international trade volumes2.

Tax Cuts and Deregulation: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 was a cornerstone of Trump's economic agenda. While the tax cuts provided a short-term boost to the U.S. economy, they also contributed to a growing federal deficit. Deregulation efforts, particularly in the environmental sector, aimed to reduce the regulatory burden on businesses but raised concerns about long-term sustainability and environmental impact3.

Impact on Global Investment: Trump's policies had mixed effects on global investment. While the tax cuts and deregulation attracted some foreign investment to the U.S., the uncertainty created by trade wars and protectionist measures deterred investors from committing to long-term projects. The overall impact on global investment was a net negative, as businesses faced increased risks and uncertainties5.

Conclusion: Donald Trump's presidency had a profound impact on the global economy. His policies of protectionism, tax cuts, and deregulation led to short-term gains for the U.S. economy but also created significant challenges for international trade and investment. The long-term effects of these policies continue to shape the global economic landscape.
